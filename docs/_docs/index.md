The COVID-19 outbreak simulator simulates is an individual based stochastic simulator that simulates the outbreak of COVID-19
in a population, subject to changes of population (addition and removal of individuals), model (e.g. production number
to mimic varying level of social distancing), and various preventative (quarantine, testing) and post-outbreak
opeartions (quarantine, testing, removal of symptomatic individuals etc). With realistic modeling of the course of
infection of each individual, this simulator can be used to simulate a variety of scenarios for risk assessment and
continuity planning.

The simulator provides

* At the low level
  * A core simulator that simulates the dynamic of populations over time.
  * A plugin system that provides multiple plugins for different applications.
  * Multiple scripts and tools to analyze executed simulations and generate reports.

* At a higher level
  * Notebooks that apply the simulator for different applications, with command
    used and analysis of results.
  * Utility to execute the notebooks with different parameters, which can be considered
    a higher level interface for the simulator.
